<h1>My Goals</h1>
<p>Finish {{today}} by Wednesday.</p>

<ul>
  <!-- 
    *ngFor is a structural directive.
    
    A directive is a class that changes either the appearance and
    the behaviour of html element or changes the structure of a
    template, by adding or removing elements.

    Here we have a directive that is meant to loop through the list of goals array and assign each a temporary variable called goal.
    We then display each goal variable as a list element.

    The attribute i = index registers the position index of each
    list item in the loop.
  -->
  <div *ngFor='let goal of goals; let i = index'>
    <li>{{goal.id}}. {{goal.name}}</li>

    <!--
      Below we create a button where by if we click it we want it
      to trigger the toggleDetails function that will take in the
      index of the particular goal.

      This is an example of Output Property binding. Where by our output is a clicked bound to the toggleDetail function.
    -->
    <button (click)="toggleDetails(i)">Toggle Details</button>

    <!--
      Below we add the app-goal-details selector that will be 
      responsible for  displaying the details of our goals.

      We then pass in the goal to be displayed using the 
        `[goal]=goal`
      syntax.

      Here we are working with Angular's Input property capabilities
      where can pass data to child components from our views.

      In this case we have the `goal` that we pass from the main
      goal component to the goal-details component.

      This is made possible through the @Input decorator that we use in the goal-details component. Connecting the child with the parent.


      To make the Output binding property work we have to add the
      *ngIf directive to our child component that check the boolean
      state of the goal showDescription property.

      Cont..from Goals.ts

      This leads me to believe that the actual default of showDescription is true. Such that if goal.showDescription is true the description is displayed.

      If it is false. It is not displayed.

      More info in goal.component.ts.
    -->
    <app-goal-details *ngIf="goal.showDescription" [goal]="goal"></app-goal-details>
  </div>
</ul>

<!-- 
  Another structural directive is the *ngIf that adds some
  conditional logic to out templates.

  In this case it allow us to show or hide the following paragraph
  based on the number of goals we have defined in our goals array.
-->

<p *ngIf="goals.length > 3">You are too legit to quit. Keep things manageable though.</p>
