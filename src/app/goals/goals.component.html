    A DIRECTIVE is a class that changes either the appearance and the behaviour of html element or changes the structure of
    a template, by adding or removing elements.

    We have two types of directives.

    1. Structural directives.
      - Change the structure of the template

    2. Attribute directives.
      - Change the appearance and the behaviours of the elements.


    *ngFor is a structural directive.
    
    Here we have a directive that is meant to loop through the list of goals array and assign each a temporary variable called goal.
    We then display each goal variable as a list element.

    The attribute i = index registers the position index of each
    list item in the loop.
  -->
  <div class="row mb-3" *ngFor='let goal of goals; let i = index'>
    <div class="row">
      <!-- 
      Below we add the | date pipe that transforms the date object to
      a simple month, day/date and year format.
      
      We can also chain pipes. In this case we chain the completeDate
      property with the uppercase pipe.
    -->
      <h4 id="{{i}}" appStrikeThrough>{{goal.id}}. {{goal.goal}} - Due {{goal.completeDate | date | uppercase}}</h4>

      <!--
        We update our Goal details component and change toggleDetail()to gotToUrl() that takes in a goal.id.

        This will be responsible for triggering the navigation to the
        details component.

        This is an example of Output Property binding. Where by our output is a clicked bound to the goToUrl function.
    -->
      <button class="btn btn-info ml-3" (click)="goToUrl(goal.id)">View Details</button>
      <button class="btn btn-danger ml-3" (click)="deleteGoal(i)">Delete Goals</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- 
  Another structural directive is the *ngIf that adds some
  conditional logic to out templates.

  In this case it allow us to show or hide the following paragraph
  based on the number of goals we have defined in our goals array.
-->

<p *ngIf="goals.length > 3">You are too legit to quit. Keep things manageable though.</p>
